                Listed below are the websites that ClickTrails has collected
                data on. The data for each website includes which links and
                buttons you have clicked on each website and how many times they
                were clicked. Please deselect the websites that you don’t want
                to include in your data download – specifically, any data that
                you don’t want researchers to see.
